My background (B.F.A.) is in art/design and code development, focusing on desktop & mobile layouts(now with Bootstrap), database administration and now e-commerce using Shopify, Magento and WooCommerce on WordPress. Nowadays, I strictly hand-code everything although I've had a lot of experience with IDE's like Dreamweaver (having started back when it was called Adobe GoLive) and with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and the rest of Adobe's Creative Suite.  A lot of my work was converting .PSD's to HTML and then integrating with whichever framework or platform the client wanted.  I have been working and writing by hand web standards for a long time now (HTML5, CCS3, JS/jQuery & XML), do version control using git, have done SEO in the past and do sysadmin and other back-end tasks (PHP + SQL).
